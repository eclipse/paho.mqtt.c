.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Structure to define call options\&. For MQTT 5\&.0 there is input data as well as that describing the response method\&. So there is now also a synonym \fBMQTTAsync_callOptions\fP to better reflect the use\&. This responseOptions name is kept for backward compatibility\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "char struct_id[4]"
The eyecatcher for this structure\&. Must be MQTR 
.SS "int struct_version"
The version number of this structure\&. Must be 0 or 1 if 0, no MQTTV5 options 
.SS "\fBMQTTAsync_onSuccess\fP* onSuccess"
A pointer to a callback function to be called if the API call successfully completes\&. Can be set to NULL, in which case no indication of successful completion will be received\&. 
.SS "\fBMQTTAsync_onFailure\fP* onFailure"
A pointer to a callback function to be called if the API call fails\&. Can be set to NULL, in which case no indication of unsuccessful completion will be received\&. 
.SS "void* context"
A pointer to any application-specific context\&. The the \fIcontext\fP pointer is passed to success or failure callback functions to provide access to the context information in the callback\&. 
.SS "\fBMQTTAsync_token\fP token"
A token is returned from the call\&. It can be used to track the state of this request, both in the callbacks and in future calls such as \fBMQTTAsync_waitForCompletion\fP\&. This is output only - any change by the application will be ignored\&. 
.SS "\fBMQTTAsync_onSuccess5\fP* onSuccess5"
A pointer to a callback function to be called if the API call successfully completes\&. Can be set to NULL, in which case no indication of successful completion will be received\&. 
.SS "\fBMQTTAsync_onFailure5\fP* onFailure5"
A pointer to a callback function to be called if the API call successfully completes\&. Can be set to NULL, in which case no indication of successful completion will be received\&. 
.SS "\fBMQTTProperties\fP properties"
MQTT V5 input properties 
.SS "\fBMQTTSubscribe_options\fP subscribeOptions"

.SS "int subscribeOptionsCount"

.SS "\fBMQTTSubscribe_options\fP* subscribeOptionsList"
