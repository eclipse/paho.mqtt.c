.SH NAME
offline_publish \- Publish While Disconnected 
This feature was not originally available because with persistence enabled, messages could be stored locally without ever knowing if they could be sent\&. The client application could have created the client with an erroneous broker address or port for instance\&.
.PP
To enable messages to be published when the application is disconnected \fBMQTTAsync_createWithOptions\fP must be used instead of \fBMQTTAsync_create\fP to create the client object\&. The \fBMQTTAsync_createOptions\fP field sendWhileDisconnected must be set to non-zero, and the maxBufferedMessages field set as required - the default being 100\&.
.PP
\fBMQTTAsync_getPendingTokens\fP can be called to return the ids of the messages waiting to be sent, or for which the sending process has not completed\&.
